# MadLibs

This MadLibs app, served up on Heroku, is the classic game we all know and love freshened up with 21st century style. Built using ReactJS and SCSS it asks a user for various parts of a sentence. Once the user clicks "Generate MadLib" the madlib is filled in with the user's input, and voila, the nonsensical quirkiness is ready for all to enjoy!
